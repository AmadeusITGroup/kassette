## IMock.delay property

The currently computed delay that will be applied, configured either by a call to [setDelay](./kassette.imock.setdelay.md)<!-- -->, or by [the global setting](./kassette.cliconfigurationspec.delay.md)<!-- -->. Note that if the delay is set to `recorded` and the local mock to use is not yet loaded, the value returned by this getter will be the default delay and not the recorded delay.

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly delay: number;
```
