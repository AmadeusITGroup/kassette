## MockData.ignoredHeaders property

Ignored headers, which are recorded headers that should not be served back. In practice, this is mainly the `content-length` header (because the `content-length` header that is actually served back is computed based on the actual data to send).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly ignoredHeaders?: Readonly<IncomingHttpHeaders>;
```
