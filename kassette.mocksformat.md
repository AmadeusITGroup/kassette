## MocksFormat type

Specifies the mocks format to use. It can be defined globally through the [mocksFormat](./kassette.cliconfigurationspec.mocksformat.md) setting or per-request from the [hook](./kassette.configurationspec.hook.md) method through [setMocksFormat](./kassette.imock.setmocksformat.md)<!-- -->.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type MocksFormat = 'folder' | 'har';
```

## Remarks

Here are the two possible formats:

- the `folder` format is specific to kassette and stores each request with its response in one folder containing up to 7 files: `data.json` (headers, status code and message of the response, as specified in [MockData](./kassette.mockdata.md)<!-- -->), `body.[ext]` (content of the body of the backend response), `input-request.json` (headers, method, URL and body file name of the input request, from client to proxy, for debug), `input-request-body.[ext]` (content of the body of the input request), `forwarded-request.json` (headers, method, URL, whether body was eventually a string or a Buffer and body file name of the forwarded request, from proxy to backend, for debug), `forwarded-request-body.[ext]` (the content of the body of the forwarded request), `checksum` (if a checksum was computed, the content generated to compute it). `[ext]` is an extension computed based on the actual type of the content in the file.

- the `har` [format](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec) is supported [by several other tools](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-adopters/) and can store multiple requests with their responses in a single (json-based) file. In this file, each request/response couple follows the structure specified in [HarFormatEntry](./kassette.harformatentry.md)<!-- -->.
