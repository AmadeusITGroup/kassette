## Payload interface

The payload represents the content of an HTTP response from the backend, no matter if it actually comes from it or if it was created manually.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface Payload 
```

## Remarks

A payload is often wrapped in [PayloadWithOrigin](./kassette.payloadwithorigin.md)<!-- -->. To create the wrapped payload, you can use [createPayload](./kassette.imock.createpayload.md)<!-- -->.

From the wrapped payload, response to the client can be filled with [fillResponseFromPayload](./kassette.imock.fillresponsefrompayload.md)<!-- -->.

The payload can also be persisted and read, to avoid contacting the backend later on.
