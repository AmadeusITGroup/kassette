## PayloadOrigin type

Origin of the payload.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type PayloadOrigin = 'local' | 'proxy' | 'remote' | 'user';
```

## Remarks

Here are the possible values:

- `local`<!-- -->: if the payload was read from local mock

- `remote`<!-- -->: if the payload was fetched from the remote backend by forwarding the request

- `user`<!-- -->: if the payload has been created from the user, manually using [createPayload](./kassette.imock.createpayload.md)

- `proxy`<!-- -->: if the payload has been created from kassette itself, especially for `404 Not found` errors (in `local` mode) and `502 Bad Gateway` errors (when kassette cannot reach the remote server)
