## kassette package

kassette is a development server, used mainly for testing, which proxies requests and is able to easily manage local mocks.

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [runFromAPI(options)](./kassette.runfromapi.md) | Launch the proxy programmatically. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [APIOptions](./kassette.apioptions.md) | Specifies the argument expected to start kassette programmatically with [runFromAPI()](./kassette.runfromapi.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [ChecksumArgs](./kassette.checksumargs.md) | Type of the argument expected by [checksum](./kassette.imock.checksum.md)<!-- -->. It specifies which data from the request to include in the checksum. |
|  [CLIConfigurationSpec](./kassette.cliconfigurationspec.md) | The set of possible properties defined through the CLI (it is reduced since it can't contain runtime values) |
|  [ConfigurationSpec](./kassette.configurationspec.md) | Augments the CLI spec to add all pure runtime properties, that can be defined through the configuration file only |
|  [Connection](./kassette.connection.md) | A connection intercepted by kassette |
|  [ConsoleSpec](./kassette.consolespec.md) | Console with logging methods. |
|  [FilterableSpec](./kassette.filterablespec.md) | Interface used in [ChecksumArgs](./kassette.checksumargs.md) for each piece of data that can be filtered (i.e. modified) before it is included in the hash computed by the [checksum](./kassette.imock.checksum.md) method. |
|  [GetConfigurationProps](./kassette.getconfigurationprops.md) | Parameter of the [getConfiguration](./kassette.iconfigurationfile.getconfiguration.md) function (which a kassette configuration file is supposed to export). |
|  [HookAPI](./kassette.hookapi.md) | Parameter of the [hook](./kassette.configurationspec.hook.md) callback, that is called for every HTTP request that kassette receives. |
|  [IConfigurationFile](./kassette.iconfigurationfile.md) | Interface that a kassette configuration file should export. |
|  [IConfigurationProperty](./kassette.iconfigurationproperty.md) | Contains the value and origin of a configuration property. |
|  [IFetchedRequest](./kassette.ifetchedrequest.md) | A handier wrapper around a request |
|  [IMock](./kassette.imock.md) | The public interface exposed to the end user to handle a given request and the associated mock and response.<!-- -->An object implementing this interface is passed to the [hook](./kassette.configurationspec.hook.md) function, under property <code>mock</code> of the single argument object. |
|  [IncludableSpec](./kassette.includablespec.md) | Base interface used in [ChecksumArgs](./kassette.checksumargs.md) for each piece of data that can be included or not in the hash computed by the [checksum](./kassette.imock.checksum.md) method. |
|  [IProxyConnectAPI](./kassette.iproxyconnectapi.md) | A handier wrapper around a CONNECT request |
|  [IResponse](./kassette.iresponse.md) | A handier wrapper around a server response |
|  [MockData](./kassette.mockdata.md) | The data representing the mock, which is persisted and used for serving the mock |
|  [MockingOptions](./kassette.mockingoptions.md) | Configuration options, including the root folder used to resolve relative paths and the current global configuration. |
|  [Payload](./kassette.payload.md) | The payload represents the content of an HTTP response from the backend, no matter if it actually comes from it or if it was created manually. |
|  [PayloadWithOrigin](./kassette.payloadwithorigin.md) | Contains the payload along with its origin. |
|  [RemotePayload](./kassette.remotepayload.md) | Remote payload and the request that was made to get it. |
|  [RequestPayload](./kassette.requestpayload.md) | Content of an HTTP request. |
|  [Status](./kassette.status.md) | The response status |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [ConfigurationPropertySource](./kassette.configurationpropertysource.md) | The id of the source of the resolved value. |
|  [Delay](./kassette.delay.md) | Delay that will be used to send the response to the client when the data is taken from the local mock. |
|  [Headers](./kassette.headers.md) | A map from strings to strings or array of strings |
|  [IMergedConfiguration](./kassette.imergedconfiguration.md) | The resulting configuration that was merged from its different [sources](./kassette.configurationpropertysource.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [ListOrFilter](./kassette.listorfilter.md) | Type used in [ChecksumArgs](./kassette.checksumargs.md) for each piece of data that has a map structure, such as the query and headers, to specify if and how they are included in the hash computed by the [checksum](./kassette.imock.checksum.md) method. |
|  [Mode](./kassette.mode.md) | The main working mode of the proxy. It can be defined globally through the [mode](./kassette.cliconfigurationspec.mode.md) setting or per-request from the [hook](./kassette.configurationspec.hook.md) method through [setMode](./kassette.imock.setmode.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [PayloadOrigin](./kassette.payloadorigin.md) | Origin of the payload. |
|  [ProxyConnectMode](./kassette.proxyconnectmode.md) | The mode describing how to process <code>CONNECT</code> requests. It can be defined globally through the [proxyConnectMode](./kassette.cliconfigurationspec.proxyconnectmode.md) setting or per-request from the [onProxyConnect](./kassette.configurationspec.onproxyconnect.md) method through [setMode](./kassette.iproxyconnectapi.setmode.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [RecursiveArray](./kassette.recursivearray.md) | A single value or a virtually unlimitedly nested array of this type of value |
