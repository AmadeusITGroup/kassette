## CLIConfigurationSpec.tlsCAKeyPath property

Path to a PEM-encoded CA (Certificate Authority) certificate and key file, created if it does not exist. If not provided, the certificate and key are generated but only kept in memory. This certificate and key are used as needed to sign certificates generated on the fly for any HTTPS connection intercepted by kassette.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly tlsCAKeyPath?: string | null;
```

## Remarks

You can optionally import in the browser the TLS certificate from this file in order to remove the warning when connecting to HTTPS websites through kassette.
