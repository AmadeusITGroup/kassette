## Delay type

Delay that will be used to send the response to the client when the data is taken from the local mock.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Delay = 'recorded' | number;
```

## Remarks

It can be expressed either as a direct value (in milliseconds) or as the `'recorded'` string, which means to use the delay recorded in the local mock (in the [time](./kassette.mockdata.time.md) field).
